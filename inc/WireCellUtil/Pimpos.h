    /** \brief Pitch-Impact-Position.

	A Pimpos object encapsulates information and methods related
	to geometry and binning of a plane of parallel and equidistant
	wires and a further uniform sub division along their pitch
	directions.

        A wire region or wire bin is the locus *centered* on a wire
        and which extends +/- 1/2 pitch from the wire position.

        An impact region or impact bin is the smaller locus of pitch
        formed by uniformly splitting a wire region.  It is *bound* by
        two (not centered on one) impact positions.

        Impact positions are "in phase" with wires" such that there is
        one impact position coincident with a wire position.

        For 3D "lab" to "plane" coordinate transformations there is a
        plane coordinate system which has these three orthogonal axes:

	axis0) anti nominal drift direction (normal to the wire plane) and
	axis1) along the wire direction such that,
	axis2) the pitch direction is the cross product of axis0 X axis1.

    class Pimpos {
    public:
	/** Create a Pimpos object for a particular plane.
	    
            \param nwires is the number of wires in the plane.

            \param minwirepitch is the location in the pitch
            coordinate of the first (zero index) wire.

            \param maxwirepitch is the location in the pitch
            coordinate of the last wire (ie, index=nwires-1).

	    \param wire is a Vector which sets the direction of the
	    wires in the plane.  If the underlying wires are not
	    exactly parallel, this should be some representative
	    average wire direction.

	    \param pitch is a Vector which sets the direction and of
            the pitch of the wires in the plane.  The pitch should be
            such that the cross product, wire (x) pitch, points in the
            anti-drift direction for the region this plane services.
            If the underlying wires are not exactly parallel, this
            pitcvector should be some representative average pitch
            direction.

	    \param origin is a Point which sets an origin for all
	    transforms.  In particular, the projection of this origin
	    point along the drift direction to the plane of wires sets
	    the origin for the pitch coordinate.

	    \param nbins gives the number of of impact bins covering
	    one wire region.

	    The pitch extents and the origin vector must be expressed
	    in the WCT system of (length) units.
